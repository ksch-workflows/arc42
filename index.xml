All the client applications are Flutter apps. They are using the ksch-dart-client library for accessing the REST API of the backend.
The registration-desk is a Flutter Web app to be used at the registration desk of the KSCH.
Later on there should also be a Flutter Web app for the pharmacy desk.</description></item><item><title>Constraints</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/02_constraints/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/02_constraints/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Context and scope</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/03_context-and-scope/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/03_context-and-scope/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Crosscutting concepts</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/08_crosscutting-concepts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/08_crosscutting-concepts/</guid><description> How links are added to REST resources across modules</description></item><item><title>Deployment view</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/07_deployment-view/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/07_deployment-view/</guid><description>Development The backend is hosted on the Google App Engine.
The Flutter Web apps for the various work stations are hosted on GitHub pages. It might be better not to bundle those components during development, so that the online apps can be updated independently. This simplifies the continuous deployment process and shortes the build times and thus the feedback cycle.
Staging The final QA for production releases could be done with temporay VMs hosted on the Digital Ocean platform, using the same app structure like the production system.</description></item><item><title>Domain Driven Design</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/04_solution-strategy/ddd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/04_solution-strategy/ddd/</guid><description>Motivation Form follows function
The purpose of this software system is to support the day-to-day processes in the Kirpal Sagar Charitable Hospital. How the system is structured internally is a secondary matter. What is important is that it supports the functional and operational requirements of the hospital staff. Further, it is important that the system can be molded when there the requirements are changing. So when new developers are coming into the system, it should be fairly easy for them to add new features or adapt existing features.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/12_glossary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/12_glossary/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Imprint</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/imprint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/imprint/</guid><description>Impressum Angaben gemäß § 5 TMG: Jan Mewes

Thus the source code should have maximum simplicity. The software needs to be simple to operate, so that the KSCH staff can operate is by themselves. The software needs to be fast. There should be no vendor lock-in so that the KSCH doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a strong binding dependency on any external company.</description></item><item><title>Java application architecture style</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/09_architecture-decisions/2021-05-08_backend-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/09_architecture-decisions/2021-05-08_backend-architecture/</guid><description>Context There needs to be a concept for the module structure of the backend server.
Design goals The business logic of the software needs to be very flexible, so that it can be adjusted to changing requirements of the KSCH. The system needs to have good testability, so that there can be a very good test coverage for those business rules. Enable hobby developer to contribute to the project in limited spare time.</description></item><item><title>Quality</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/10_quality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/10_quality/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Runtime view</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/06_runtime-view/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/06_runtime-view/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Testing</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/04_solution-strategy/testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/04_solution-strategy/testing/</guid><description>Rules of thumb In general, write a test class for every class in the production code.

Relativly small learning curve for new contributors. Supports the reaction of a well designed, modular page structure. Very active community. The framework is time-tested and stable. Cons Adding pages with highly dynamic content requires JavaScript which is possible to be hooked into Wicket applications but this gets more and more complicated and thus goes against the goal of maximum simplicity of the source code.</description></item><item><title>Use Google App Engine for the deployment of the staging environment</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/09_architecture-decisions/2021-03-05_backend-technoglogy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/09_architecture-decisions/2021-03-05_backend-technoglogy/</guid><description>Context In order to iterative development cycles for acceptance testing and user experience design, it is necessary provide the software in a publicly accessible domain. Since the instance will only be sporadicly used at random times, having an always online instance hosted on a rented virtual machine would be wasteful.
Alternatives (A) AWS Lambda Pros AWS offers lots of powerful features to build web applications. The usage based pricing plans lead to fair operational costs.</description></item><item><title>Use Java instead of Kotlin</title><link>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/09_architecture-decisions/2021-03-07_java-vs-kotlin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ksch-workflows.github.io/arc42/09_architecture-decisions/2021-03-07_java-vs-kotlin/</guid><description>Context Kotlin tries to solve some of the problem in the design of the Java programming language. There are many senior developers which advocate to use Kotlin over Java. Also it is preferred by many mid-level developers.
Alternatives (A) Java Pros Very broadly used Many tools which support the language Lots of tutorials Cons Verbose syntax No null safety (B) Kotlin Pros Null safety Good reputation Enables to write elegant code Cons Pushes for certain design ideas (e.</description></item></channel></rss>
